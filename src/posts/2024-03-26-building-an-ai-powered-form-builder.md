I wanted to share some cool technical details about a form builder project I've been working on. What makes it special? It combines the power of AI with a modern React stack to create a super intuitive form building experience.

## Tech Stack

The project is built with:

- Next.js
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- OpenAI's GPT-4 for AI form generation
- JSON Schema for form structure

## AI Magic

The coolest part is how I integrate AI into the form building process. Using GPT-4, users can describe their form in plain English, and the system generates a complete form structure. Here's how it works:

- The AI form generator takes a natural language prompt and converts it into a structured JSON Schema
- It not only generates the basic form fields but also handles:
  - Field validation rules
  - UI layout and ordering
  - Custom button text
  - Theme customization
  - Field descriptions and placeholders

## Architecture Deep Dive

The form builder is structured around three main components:

### Schema Management

- Uses JSON Schema for form structure definition
- Maintains separate UI schema for presentation logic
- Handles dynamic field ordering and validation rules

### Form Renderer

- Real-time preview of the form being built
- Custom field templates for different input types
- Responsive layout with theme customization

### AI Integration

- Smart prompt processing with GPT-4
- Generates both schema and UI configuration
- Handles complex form patterns and validations

## Smart Features

The system includes some pretty neat features:

- Theme Customization: Handles everything from colors to button styles
- Live Preview: Real-time form rendering as you build
- Export Options: Can export to StackBlitz for immediate use
- Drag-and-Drop: Intuitive field reordering
- Smart Defaults: AI generates sensible defaults based on field types

## The Schema Magic

One of the coolest technical aspects is how I handle form schemas. Instead of just generating basic HTML forms, I create a complete JSON Schema that includes:

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      // Dynamic form fields
    },
    "required": []
  },
  "uiSchema": {
    "ui:order": [],
    // Field-specific UI configurations
  },
  "theme": {
    // Custom styling options
  }
}
```

## Export and Share

We can instantly deploy your form to StackBlitz or export it as a standalone component. The exported forms are self-contained and don't require the form builder dependencies.
